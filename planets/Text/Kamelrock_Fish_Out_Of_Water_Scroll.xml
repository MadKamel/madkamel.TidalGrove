	<TextBlock>
		<ID>1</ID>
		<Text>POKE: What interesting creatures these are! Mere minutes ago when this planet was flooded, these fish were swimming and playing with such vigor, but once the water fell they seem to have begun breathing air and every single one has stopped moving.</Text>

		<ID>2</ID>
		<ParentID>1</ParentID>
		<Text>OENO: I imagine that this is how they sleep. Melorae has told me stories of creatures she had seen, and many of them sleep in specific conditions, such as darkness. Perhaps dryness triggers sleep in these fish?</Text>

		<ParentID>1</ParentID>
		<Text>CLARY: How can you tell that they are breathing air? Suppose they are holding onto oxygen within, somehow?</Text>

		<ID>4</ID>
		<ParentID>3</ParentID>
		<Text>AVENS: I can see them moving; it appears that their bodies are slowly rising and falling. They likely posses lungs.</Text>

		<ParentID>2</ParentID>
		<Text>CLARY: Perhaps we as a species were not so different, once? I find that heat makes me feel more alert than the cold. Perhaps our ancestors slept in the night as the air cooled, and woke as the day's warmth arrived?</Text>
	</TextBlock>
	<TextBlock>
		<ID>6</ID>
		<ParentID>5</ParentID>
		<Text>OENO: I would very much like to know about our species' past, but if we wanted to meet and ask another clan what they knew, we would first have to repair our mortally wounded vessel.</Text>
	</TextBlock>
	<TextBlock>
		<ID>7</ID>
		<ParentID>2</ParentID>
		<Text>AVENS: They do seem very much asleep, I wonder how long it takes for them to wake up after the water starts flooding again?</Text>
