		<Text>Should we excavate <![CDATA[<color=orange>Tidal Grove</color>]]>? We stand to gain an understanding of how it stores and releases water, but the environmental impact is of major concern.</Text>

		<Text>CLARY: The fish tend to stay near the <![CDATA[<color=orange>North Pole</color>]]>. If we dug at the <![CDATA[<color=orange>South Pole</color>]]>, it would likely not impact them at all. We already use the <![CDATA[<color=orange>South Pole</color>]]> as a staging area for visitors.</Text>

		<Text>FILIX: Displacing the stone would likely lower the water's height, altering the environment. The issue most obvious to me is that excavating a hole wide enough for a Nomai is not a great solution.</Text>
