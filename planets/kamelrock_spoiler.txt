version 0.1
Kamel's Sponge was found by Nomai long ago. It was decidedly too boring for them to explore and was otherwise already inhabited by a species of fish, so they left it for the most part alone. Nomai who felt so inclined would, on occasion, visit Kamel's Sponge and examine the surface. 

The fish in Kamel's Sponge lived in the water, and they dealt with the tide by going into a hibernetic state when the water receded. Their breeding grounds were at either pole, which is where they laid their eggs inside of trees. When the interloper struck, the tide was low, and none of the fish survived.

Kamel's Sponge gives off a strange signal, but it remains unexplained.

version 0.2
Kamel's Sponge is now Tidal Grove. The North Pole was the local fish's breeding ground, and they laid eggs in trees. They did not survive the Interloper, as the tide was low at the time of ghost matter being dispersed.
